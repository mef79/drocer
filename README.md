Cleveland City Council's records are available as PDFs from 1996-present.

As PDFs, there's many things that you cannot to do with them:
search in multiple files at one time; easily extract data from them for further analysis; browse legislation by a particular topic; and more.

In short, PDFs make it very difficult for programmers, journalists, researchers to use the data inside them.

## What's here:

These are the files of Cleveland City Council's meeting notes converted into plain text that make it easier for people to analyze.

These files are not recommended for reading. There are additional small errors like misspellings, improper spacing,

Some information, notably tables and lists, are missing from these text files.
Check the [original PDFs](http://clevelandcitycouncil.org/the-city-record/) or download them [by year in bulk](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzsFcr5qTHxEfmFUTzVNNWsxdjYzRmpDbTBHX3dyTUVkZWk3WlA5aVdKQ0tFZHVpckdfWEk&usp=drive_web) to verify if any information is missing.
